One thing you could do is mount the current folder as a volume instead of copying, and change the `ping.sh` script between `docker exec` calls.

## Third Exercise

Build and experiment with the html example.

<details>

<summary>Hint</summary>

By default, this Dockerfile will copy the `index.html` file and expose port `80` to the world. 

Try to make it run with a volume mount, and bind port 80 to something accessible on the host.

Change the `index.html` file, and verify that the changes are replicated in your browser.
