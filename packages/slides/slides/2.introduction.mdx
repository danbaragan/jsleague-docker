# Conclusion

<Appear> 

Docker is a virtualization solution, more lightweight, therefore easier to use in development and production, as well as to scale, than existing VM solutions. Just by using docker you can create a self-contained ecosystem that can scale easily, and be deployed prebuilt / pre-configured, with little or no overhead.
