```makefile
FROM alpine
```

<div>

Any dockerfile should start with a point of origin.

In this case, we're using a bare-bones alpine linux distribution.

Other options are, for example: <Code>ubuntu</Code>, <Code>node</Code>, <Code>python</Code>, etc...

FROM alpine

RUN app add node
```

One of the most used commands is the run command. 

It will simply execute a command on the container, at build-time.

Basically, anything that you *can* use in the container (basic linux tools, such as: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, etc and subsequent installed tools) will function here.

``` 5:6,3[13:17]
FROM alpine

RUN app add node

COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .
```

<div>

The second-most used command in Dockerfiles is the *copy* command;

Its purpose is to copy files from the host operating system to the container, to be used in future build steps.

In this case, we're copying the dependencies files for a nodejs application.

``` 8,3[13:17]
FROM alpine

RUN app add node

COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .

RUN npm install
```

<div>

Since we have a list of dependencies, we can now install them.

``` 10:11,3[13:17]
FROM alpine

RUN app add node

COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .

RUN npm install

ENTRYPOINT echo "NODE: $(node -v) & NPM: $(npm -v)"
CMD npm run start
```

<div>

To actually run something in the container, we have a few options.

One is the `entrypoint` command. It defines how the container should execute if ran by itself.

Another is the `cmd` command. It is similar to the `entrypoint` command, but it can be overriden while running the container.
